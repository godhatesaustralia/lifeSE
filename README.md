"A system of cells interlinked within
cells interlinked within cells interlinked
within one stem. And dreadfully distinct
against the dark, a tall white fountain played.

I realized, of course, that it was made
not of our atoms; that the sense behind
the scene was not our sense. In life, the mind
of any man is quick to recognize
natural shams, and then before his eyes
the reed becomes a bird, the knobby twig
an inchworm, and the cobra head, a big
wickedly folded moth. But in the case
of my white fountain what it did replace
perceptually was something that, I felt,
could be grasped only by whoever dwelt
in the strange world where I was a mere stray."
